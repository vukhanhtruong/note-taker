### Context

The project requires a modern, responsive, and interactive frontend to provide a smooth user experience. The frontend needs to be maintainable, scalable, and capable of interacting efficiently with a RESTful API.

### Decision

React will be used as the frontend framework for the web application.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** React's component-based architecture will help in building reusable UI components, improving code maintainability and reusability.
- **Positive:** React has a strong ecosystem which can be used if the application grows in complexity.
- **Positive:** React's virtual DOM provides efficient updates and rendering, which enhances the application's performance.
- **Negative:** The learning curve for new developers might be steep if they are not familiar with React.
