# 4. API Design with RESTful Principles and OpenAPI Documentation

Date: 2024-12-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application requires a well-defined interface for communication between the frontend and backend. The API should be easy to use, scalable, and adhere to web standards. Additionally, there is a need to ensure that the API is well-documented, standardized, and easy to integrate with other systems.

## Decision

The API will be designed following RESTful principles and documented using the OpenAPI standard. Swagger will be used to generate and maintain the API documentation.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** A RESTful API design aligns with web standards and is widely understood, making it easier for frontend developers and external systems to interact with the backend.
- **Positive:** RESTful APIs are stateless, which simplifies the server-side logic and improves scalability.
- **Positive:** The use of OpenAPI ensures that the API is described in a standard format, which facilitates integration with other systems and tools.
- **Positive:** Swagger provides an interactive API documentation interface, making it easier for developers to explore and test the API endpoints.
- **Positive:** The use of OpenAPI and Swagger promotes consistency in API design, helps in generating client libraries, and ensures that the documentation stays up-to-date with the actual API implementation.
- **Negative:** The additional step of maintaining OpenAPI documentation might introduce overhead, particularly if not automated as part of the development process.
- **Negative:** Developers need to be familiar with OpenAPI specifications and Swagger tools, which could require some learning and adaptation time.

### Implementation Details

- **OpenAPI Specification:** The API will be described using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. This will include defining endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and error codes.
- **Swagger Integration:** Swagger will be integrated into the project to automatically generate API documentation from the OpenAPI specification. This documentation will be available for developers and external users to explore the API.
- **Automation:** The OpenAPI documentation will be generated as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure it remains consistent with the actual API implementation.
- **Client Libraries:** The OpenAPI specification can be used to generate client libraries in various programming languages, simplifying integration for external developers.

### Tools and Technologies

- **HonoJS with Swagger Module:** The HonoJS framework will utilize the [chanfana library](https://chanfana.pages.dev/routers/hono/) to generate the OpenAPI specification and Swagger UI.
- **Swagger UI:** A self-hosted Swagger UI will be provided as part of the development environment for easy access to the API documentation.
