# 3. Clean Architecture

Date: 2024-12-12

## Status

Accepted

### Context

The application needs to be maintainable, testable, and adaptable to future changes. The architecture should enforce separation of concerns, allowing independent development, testing, and scaling of different application layers (e.g., UI, business logic, data access).

### Decision

The project will follow Clean Architecture principles.

### Consequences

- **Positive:** Clean Architecture promotes separation of concerns, making the system more maintainable and adaptable to changes.
- **Positive:** The use of interfaces for dependency injection enables easier testing and the ability to swap implementations (e.g., database, external services) without affecting other layers.
- **Positive:** The application is structured in layers, with the inner layers (business logic) being independent of outer layers (UI, frameworks, databases), ensuring that the core business logic is not tied to specific technologies.
- **Negative:** Initial setup and understanding of the architecture might require more effort, especially for developers new to Clean Architecture.
